        This is a box that boosts user’s mood. It combines aromatherapy and light therapy components in one device. It’s portable, compact, and accessible. The team worked together passionately to bring it to the prototyping stage. This object is perfect for this season as the sun sets early and experiencing the cold weather blues.</div>

        A bunch of Zoom meetings, WhatsApp messages, and Google Slides editing. Our idea of the therapy box wasn’t on the same page; however, a lot of communication have led us to the finalization of our therapy box. Through the process, a lot of technical questions about wires, weight support, batteries, had us stomp. We really had to consider the box if we weren’t in a pandemic, and if the maker lab available to us. Our box is completely different than a regular box: it serves meaning and service for the user as it’s a two-in-one product. Re-designing the look and how it functions is how our box hacks a traditional box.

        The unhoused are specifically vulnerable without shelter. My team and I wanted to help in any way possible. This coat serves as other services as it transforms into a backpack and sleeping bag. We also implemented heating technology activation to keep the user warm, while using recycled materials for the object itself.</div>

    <div><h2>My Angle</h2></div>
    <div>
        Instead of conceptualizing a specific object, like a box, we were able to be more open-minded and branched out to different ideas. I believe the first idea we came up was about motion censored faucets. We then brainstormed new ideas while keeping the faucet in mind. As all of us are keeping warm in ours houses, we fail to recognize those who don’t have a roof over their heads. Being grateful to have such privilege, we shifted our focus right onto the homeless epidemic. I remembered a social media post I kept seeing online about Khaleel Seivwright, a Toronto carpenter, who is building and providing shelters for the unhoused from his GoFundMe donors. He refuses to stop his good Samaritan work because the City of Toronto warned him to stop.
